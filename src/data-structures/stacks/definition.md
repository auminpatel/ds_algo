**Stack**
An array-like data structure whose elements follow the **LIFO** rule: **Last In, First Out**.

A stack is often compared to a stack of books on a table: the last book that's placed on the stack of books is the first one that's taken off the stack.

The following are a stack's standard operations and their corresponding time complexities:

- Pushing an element onto the stack: O(1)
- Popping an element off the stack: O(1)
- Peeking at the element on the top of the stack: O(1)
- Searching for an element in the stack: O(n)

A stack is typically implemented with a **dynamic array** or with a **singly linked list**.
