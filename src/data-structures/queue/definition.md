**Queue**

An array-like data structure whose elements follow the **FIFO** rule: **First In, First Out.**

A queue is often compared to a group of people standing in line to purchase items at a store: the first person to get in line is the first one to purchase items and to get out of the queue.

The following are a queue's standard operations and their corresponding time complexities:

- Enqueuing an element into the queue: O(1)
- Dequeuing an element out of the queue: O(1)
- Peeking at the element at the front of the queue: O(1)
- Searching for an element in the queue: O(n)


A queue is typically implemented with a **doubly linked** list.
